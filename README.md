# CocktailDB API Ripper

Python3 script to just dump the cocktailDB.

Why should you want to dump everything? Look at their API, its horrible.

The script isn't pretty, it can't really be configured, but maybe it's a good boilerplate for you

First import the cocktaildb.sql file into you MariaDB/MySQL Database. Insert you login credentials and db name, and go for it.

Implementation of a better API using the dumped data is Work in Progress. Also CocktailBot for Discord using the API is Work in Progress. Stay tuned.
