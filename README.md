# cocktailripper

Python3 script to just dump the cocktailDB 

Why should you want to dump everything? Look at their API, its horrible.

The script isn't pretty, can't really be configured, but maybe it's a good boilerplate for you

First import the cocktaildb.sql file into you MariaDB/MySQL Database. Insert you login credentials and db name, and go for it.
